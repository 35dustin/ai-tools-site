      <p class="text-lg">
        Transparency matters to us. Here's exactly how this site earns money and how it affects (or doesn't affect) our content.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4">How We Earn Revenue</h2>
      <p>
        AI Tools Review participates in affiliate programs with some of the products we review. When you click certain links on our site and make a purchase or sign up for a service, we may receive a small commission from that company.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="text-text-primary">This costs you nothing extra.</strong> The price you pay is the same whether you use our link or go directly to the product's website. The commission comes from the company's marketing budget, not your wallet.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4">What This Means for Our Reviews</h2>
      <p>
        Affiliate commissions <strong class="text-text-primary">never influence our ratings, rankings, or recommendations.</strong> We review tools we believe are genuinely useful, and we're honest about their shortcomings whether we have an affiliate relationship or not.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>We frequently recommend free tools that earn us nothing</li>
        <li>We give critical reviews to products that do have affiliate programs</li>
        <li>Our review process is identical regardless of affiliate status</li>
        <li>We clearly label affiliate links where required by the FTC</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4">Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
      <p>
        Running a review site takes real resources — subscriptions to test, time to write, and infrastructure to host. Affiliate revenue helps us keep this site running and ad-free. We'd rather earn through affiliate links than plaster the site with display ads or accept sponsored content.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4">FTC Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        In accordance with FTC guidelines, we disclose that some links on this website are affiliate links. We are a participant in various affiliate programs designed to provide a means for sites to earn fees by linking to products and services.
      </p>
