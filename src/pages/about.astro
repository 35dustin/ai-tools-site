      <p class="text-lg">
        AI Tools Review is an independent review site powered by a <strong class="text-text-primary">veteran-owned AI company</strong>. We exist because the AI tool landscape moves fast, and most "reviews" are barely-disguised ads.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4">How We Review</h2>
      <p>
        Every tool on this site has been tested by our team through real, sustained use — not a quick 15-minute demo. We sign up for free tiers and paid plans alike. We run the same tasks across competing products so comparisons are apples-to-apples.
      </p>
      <p>Our review process:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong class="text-text-primary">Minimum 2 weeks of daily use</strong> before publishing a review</li>
        <li><strong class="text-text-primary">Real-world tasks</strong> — we don't test chatbots with "write me a haiku." We test them on production code, business writing, and research</li>
        <li><strong class="text-text-primary">Multiple team members</strong> test each tool to reduce individual bias</li>
        <li><strong class="text-text-primary">Regular updates</strong> — AI tools change fast, so we re-test and update reviews quarterly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4">Our Standards</h2>
      <p>
        We don't accept payment for reviews. We don't let companies preview or edit our content. Our ratings reflect genuine opinions based on hands-on experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do use affiliate links where available, which means we may earn a small commission if you sign up through our links. This comes at no extra cost to you and helps fund our testing. Affiliate relationships never influence our ratings or recommendations. Read our full <a href="/disclosure">affiliate disclosure</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4">Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        We're a small team of engineers, writers, and AI practitioners who use these tools professionally every day. Our founder is a U.S. military veteran who started this company to bring the same discipline and integrity to tech reviews that he valued in service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're based in the United States and have been covering AI tools since the GPT-3 era. As the space has exploded, so has the need for trustworthy, no-BS reviews — and that's what we aim to deliver.
